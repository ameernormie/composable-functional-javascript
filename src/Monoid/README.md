### Algebraic Structure

A binary operation defined on a set forms a structure

```
N = {1,2,3,4,5}         operation: +

(N, +) Addition on natural numbers (forms an algebraic structure)
```

If these structures follow some properties then we give these structures some names.

### Semi-Group

Algebraic Structure (S, \*)

1. Closure:
   `∀ x, y Ɛ S, x * y Ɛ S`
2. Associativity:

   ```
   ∀ x, y, z Ɛ S
   (x * y) * z = x * (y * z)

   ```

For example, set of integers is a semi group

### Monoid

Algebraic Structure (S, \*)

1. Closure:
   `∀ x, y Ɛ S, x * y Ɛ S`
2. Associativity:

   ```
   ∀ x, y, z Ɛ S
   (x * y) * z = x * (y * z)

   ```

3. has an identity element:
   ```
   ∀x Ɛ S , x * id = x
   ```
