## Composable-functional-javascript

**`map` isn't so much about the iteration. It's more about composition within a context**
**`fold` is the idea of removing the value from its context- Taking it out of the box(Right, Left)**
**`chain` expects you to run a function and return another one**
**`semi-group` is a type with a concat method**
**`monoid` a semi-group with a special element in there that acts like an identity**

Functional programming is the first step towards error free coding

## Concepts
